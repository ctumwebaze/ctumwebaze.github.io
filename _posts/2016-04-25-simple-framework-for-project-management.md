title: Simple Framework to Manage your Project
categories: android project_management

Setting up a project for success can sometimes be a daunting task because you have a lot of cards to play. However, it can be much easier than you think.
I have found this simple project management framework to be a life saver; even when you are not a professional project manager.

## Purpose
This is the What and Why of doing what we you doing or planning to do? - For any project to be successful, you need to know what needs to be done and why it should be done. This should be articulated in clear terms to everyone who is and will be working on the project.

I once worked on a project that i joined way after it had started. I was oriented in terms of what needed to be done; but a couple of months into the project, the question of why began to arise. I did struggle quite a bit because i could not see the value of why we are doing what we are doing.

## Tasks
Once the question of purpose is sorted, the next step is to establish what needs to be done to accomplish the purpose. Here you outline the tasks that must be done e.g. If you were building an android application, some of the tasks could include

1. Conduct User Research
2. Create App Wireframes
3. Develop App
4. Open an Android Play Store Account
5. Deploy App to PlayStore

The tasks outlined will be high level without going to so much detail and will depend on the nature of the project at hand. E.g. If your app depends on third party services or input from other stakeholders, you will need to outline what needs to be done to make sure stakeholders are on board, third party services are available for your integration etc.

## Who
Now that you know what needs to be done, establish who is going to perform the tasks. Each task may require special skills some are general and no special skill set is required.

Take for example the *Create App Wireframes task*; you might need **[User Experience Designer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design)** who understands user interaction, visual design etc so that your app is visually appealing and a pleasure to work with or *Develop App task* where you will need developers to build the actual app.

The actual number of resource required will depend on the scale of the project of course. Some project a small enough to have a single developer others require two, three or more. You will of course do some kind of resource estimation to determine the numbers required depending on the tasks.

## How
How are the tasks going to be done? Is the question you ask yourself to establish what methodology to apply for what task. Some tasks are easy enough and don't require elaborate methods or procedures others do.

[Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) or [Scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) could be the answer to the how question for the **Develop App** task.

## When
When are the tasks going to be accomplished? Answering this question the right way could make the difference between success or failure. [Time to Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_market) for a project could determine whether you are a market leader or follower.

One other aspect of when the tasks are going to be accomplished is determining the dependencies among tasks. Some tasks may need to be finished before others are started and this could increase the overall project timeframe.

For non-professional project managers, this is a simple framework you can use to execute your project. It's light weight and doesn't require so many years of project management under your belt.
